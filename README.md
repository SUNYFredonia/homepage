Fredonia.edu's Home page.
========
Work on re-designing Fredonia's homepage began on 1/21/14.

The primary goal of this site is to modernize Fredonia's top-level marketing web presence. It is mobile-first with an emphasis on content. We want more stories of Fredonia front and center. 

The site's backend is easy to use via [Prose.io](https://github.com/prose/prose) and was developed with the open source static site generator, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

If you are interested in contributing, please [ping me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/nicholas_gunner). Check out our open issues... If an issue hasn't been delegated yet, it means we'd love for you to fix it:)
