Fredonia.edu's Home page.
========
Work on re-designing SUNY Fredonia's homepage began on 1/21/14.

The primary goal of this site is to modernize Fredonia's top-level marketing web presence. It is mobile-first with an emphasis on content. We want more stories of Fredonia front and center. 

The site's backend is easy to use via Prose.io and was developed with the open source static site generator, Jekyll.

If you are interested in contributing, please [ping me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/nicholas_gunner). Check out our open issues... If an issue hasn't been delegated yet, it means we'd love you to fix it:)
